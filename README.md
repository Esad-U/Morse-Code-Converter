# Morse-Code-Converter
A program to convert a message to Morse Code and play it.

This program converts a string text to morse code, and play it using a piezo buzzer.

For this I used a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B and a simple piezo buzzer. You must connect the positive pin of buzzer to a GPIO output pin. Make sure that the variable
'pin' in code is correct. Then you must connect the negative pin of buzzer to ground pin of Raspberry Pi.

After making the connections, you can run the code and enter whatever you want to convert.
